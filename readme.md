Here all of my solutions are logged and will revisit them monthly to see if they can be refactored(Atleast that's the plan)

Each file should have comments showing my logic for future reference.

Titles will tell me which problems I needed help with, had to do some research or looked up the solution.

E2E - End to end (Did it all on my own) ,  HELP - Had to do some research , Solution - Look up the solution to understand.
